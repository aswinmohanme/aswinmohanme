## whoami
I'm Aswin, finishing College midst the pandemic and would be unemployed from being a student. I don't even know what to put here. You can find most of the official thing about me here on [aswinmohan.me/about](aswinmohan.me/about)

### Me and Open Source
I can put this here I think. I love OSS, even though I am not that much of a fanatic for it. I love well crafted and beautiful softwere, would prefer it to be Open Source but loves a well crafted premium software as much.
