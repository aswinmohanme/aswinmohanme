Hey, I'm Aswin Mohan. I'm a Software Developer currently based out of Kerala, India. I love to design, code and make bold, beautiful, useful things. I love film photography, old typewriters and completely mechanical things with zero trace of electronics on the side.

I primarly work with Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, React, NextJS, React Native and TailwindCSS. I do occasional Rails, Flutter and sometimes UI/UX design to make something look less ugly.
